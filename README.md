This folder contains the network programs I have written as part of the computer networks course.
1) A comprehensive Math Server which can evaluate  arithmetic expressions (Even the complex ones :) )
2) A proxy server with extended support for HTTPS requests.
3) A simple socket program in C which emulates DHCP connections in the network.
